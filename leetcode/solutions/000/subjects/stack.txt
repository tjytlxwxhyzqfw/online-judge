What can monotonous decrease stack do?

Some applications of monotone (increase/decrease) stack in leetcode:

Next Greater Element II (a very basic one)
Largest Rectangle in Histogram(almost the same as this problem)
Maximal Rectangle(please do this problem after you solve the above one)
Trapping Rain Water (challenge)
Remove Duplicate Letters(challenge)
Remove K Digits
Create Maximum Number
132 Pattern(challenge, instead of focusing on the elements in the stack, this problem focuses on the elements poped from the monotone stack)
sliding window maximum(challenge, monotone queue)
Max Chunks To Make Sorted II
Hope this helps.
