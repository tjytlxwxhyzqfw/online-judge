------
Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in numssuch that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target. (Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.)

------
Given an integer array nums, return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Constraints: (1) 1 <= nums.length <= 10; (2) -10 <= nums[i] <= 10; (3) All the numbers of nums are unique.

 138 39.1%  Medium 4369/780 Copy List with Random Pointer
------
A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null. Return a deep copy of the list.

The Linked List is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where: (1) val: an integer representing Node.val;  (2) random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) where random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.

(Disscuss: This problem can be solve within a constant extra space)

 218 35.9%    Hard 2608/149 The Skyline Problem
------
A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively. The geometric information of each building is given in the array buildings where buildings[i] = [left_i, right_i, height_i]. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.

The skyline should be represented as a list of "key points" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

 238 61.1%  Medium 6386/494 Product of Array Except Self
------
Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  
return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of numsexcept nums[i]. 
Note: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer
Constraints: 
  (1) solve it without division and in O(n); 
  (2) solve it with constant extra space complexity

 318 52.0%  Medium 932/79 Maximum Product of Word Lengths
------
Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j])
where the two words do not share common letters. 
You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.
Constraints:
(1) 0 <= words.length <= 10^3
(2) 0 <= words[i].length <= 10^3
(3) words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.

Given a non negative integer number num. 
For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation 
and return them as an array. Solve this problem within one pass.

------
Given a n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, find the kth smallest element in the matrix.

Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
