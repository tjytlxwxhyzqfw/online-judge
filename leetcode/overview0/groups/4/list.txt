  2 34.9%  Medium Add Two Numbers
------
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

 

Example 1:


Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
Example 2:

Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
Example 3:

Input: m = 7, n = 3

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Notice that you should not modify the linked list.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
Example 3:


Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 

Constraints:

The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].

------

Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer".

One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.

Implementation the MyCircularQueue class:

MyCircularQueue(k) Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be k.
int Front() Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
int Rear() Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
boolean enQueue(int value) Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
boolean deQueue() Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
boolean isEmpty() Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
boolean isFull() Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.
 

Example 1:

Input
["MyCircularQueue", "enQueue", "enQueue", "enQueue", "enQueue", "Rear", "isFull", "deQueue", "enQueue", "Rear"]

myCircularQueue.enQueue(2); // return True
myCircularQueue.enQueue(3); // return True

myCircularQueue.isFull();   // return True
myCircularQueue.deQueue();  // return True
myCircularQueue.enQueue(4); // return True

We define a starting node to be safe if we must eventually walk to a terminal node. More specifically, there is a natural number k, so that we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than k steps for any choice of where to walk.

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

The directed graph has n nodes with labels from 0 to n - 1, where n is the length of graph. The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of labels j such that (i, j) is a directed edge of the graph, going from node i to node j.

------

On a table are N cards, with a positive integer printed on the front and back of each card (possibly different).

We flip any number of cards, and after we choose one card. 

If the number X on the back of the chosen card is not on the front of any card, then this number X is good.

What is the smallest number that is good?  If no number is good, output 0.

Here, fronts[i] and backs[i] represent the number on the front and back of card i. 

A flip swaps the front and back numbers, so the value on the front is now on the back and vice versa.

Example:

Input: fronts = [1,2,4,4,7], backs = [1,3,4,1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: If we flip the second card, the fronts are [1,3,4,4,7] and the backs are [1,2,4,1,3].
We choose the second card, which has number 2 on the back, and it isn't on the front of any card, so 2 is good.

Note:

1 <= fronts.length == backs.length <= 1000.
1 <= fronts[i] <= 2000.

------

Given a string S of digits, such as S = "123456579", we can split it into a Fibonacci-like sequence [123, 456, 579].

Formally, a Fibonacci-like sequence is a list F of non-negative integers such that:

0 <= F[i] <= 2^31 - 1, (that is, each integer fits a 32-bit signed integer type);
F.length >= 3;
and F[i] + F[i+1] = F[i+2] for all 0 <= i < F.length - 2.
Also, note that when splitting the string into pieces, each piece must not have extra leading zeroes, except if the piece is the number 0 itself.

Return any Fibonacci-like sequence split from S, or return [] if it cannot be done.

Explanation: Leading zeroes are not allowed, so "01", "2", "3" is not valid.
Example 5:

Input: "1101111"
Output: [110, 1, 111]
Explanation: The output [11, 0, 11, 11] would also be accepted.
Note:

1 <= S.length <= 200
S contains only digits.

 962 46.1%  Medium 737/20 Maximum Width Ramp
------

Given an array A of integers, a ramp is a tuple (i, j) for which i < j and A[i] <= A[j].  The width of such a ramp is j - i.

Find the maximum width of a ramp in A.  If one doesn't exist, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: [6,0,8,2,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The maximum width ramp is achieved at (i, j) = (1, 5): A[1] = 0 and A[5] = 5.
Example 2:

Input: [9,8,1,0,1,9,4,0,4,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
The maximum width ramp is achieved at (i, j) = (2, 9): A[2] = 1 and A[9] = 1.

Note:

2 <= A.length <= 50000
0 <= A[i] <= 50000
