------
Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order,
find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].
Follow up: Could you write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity?

------
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix.
This matrix has the following properties:
(1) Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
(2) The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

------
Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.
Constraints:
1) The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
2) -100 <= Node.val <= 100
