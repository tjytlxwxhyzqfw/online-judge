  87 34.4%    Hard 694/768 Scramble String
------
We can scramble a string s to get a string t using the following algorithm:
(1) If the length of the string is 1, stop.
(2) If the length of the string is > 1, do the following: 
(2.1) Split the string into two non-empty substrings at a random index, i.e., if the string is s, divide it to x and y where s = x + y.
(2.2) Randomly decide to swap the two substrings or to keep them in the same order. i.e., after this step, s may become s = x + y or s = y + x.
Apply step 1 recursively on each of the two substrings x and y.
Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, return true if s2 is a scrambled string of s1, otherwise, return false.
Constraints: (1) s1.length == s2.length (2) 1 <= s1.length <= 30 (3) s1 and s2 consist of lower-case English letters.

------
Given two words beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, 
return the length of the shortest transformation sequence from beginWordto endWord, such that:
(1) Only one letter can be changed at a time.
(2) Each transformed word must exist in the word list.
Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.

------
All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', for example: "ACGAATTCCG".
When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.

------
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.
Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value. 
The integer division should truncate toward zero.
Constraints:
(1) 1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5
(2) s consists of integers and operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') separated by some number of spaces.
(3) s represents a valid expression.
(4) All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range [0, 2^31 - 1].
(5) The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
