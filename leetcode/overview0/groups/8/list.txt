  24 52.4%  Medium 3200/199 Swap Nodes in Pairs
------
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
Example: 1,2,3,4 -> 2,1,4,3

  44 25.2%    Hard 2627/126 Wildcard Matching
------
Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*' where:
- '?' Matches any single character.
- '*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

  64 55.7%  Medium 4119/78 Minimum Path Sum
------
Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, 
which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. 
Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

  84 36.3%    Hard 5106/104 Largest Rectangle in Histogram

 124 35.2%    Hard 4972/367 Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
------
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. 
A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. 
Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.

 144 57.0%  Medium 1989/82 Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
------
Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

 164 36.5%    Hard 1045/201 Maximum Gap
------
Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.
Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.
Example: [3,6,9,1] -> 3 -> (3,6) or (6,9)
Note:
- You may assume all elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
- Try to solve it in linear time/space.

 224 37.9%    Hard 1916/151 Basic Calculator
------
Given a string s representing an expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it.
Constraints:
1) 1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5
2) s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.
3) s represents a valid expression.
