# Online Judge

As I change the input sources and included headers all the time, </br>
not all of the codes (especially the old) could be compiled correctly. </br>
But they are still worthy of referencing, for the ideas behind each solution </br>
are never changed. :)</br>
</br>
Any suggestions or commentary will be appreciated.</br>

## About this repository
</br>
I used to maintain a repo for every oj. And I updated them each time </br>
even only a single line of code gets changed.Since I coding on several </br>
different computers, I kept issuing "add", "commit", "push" and "pull" </br>
all the time. I got really tired of doing this.<br>
</br>
How stupid was I!</br>
</br>
Now I have deleted all the repositories and create this one, a</br>
unique one for all online judgements.I slow down my speed of updating this</br>
repo as well and now I usually update it after a codeforces round or a </br>
new subject of algorithms in hdoj.</br>
</br>
I breath a sigh of relief.
